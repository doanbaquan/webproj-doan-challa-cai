    <p>Street racing is typically an unsanctioned and illegal form of auto racing that occurs on a public road. 
        Racing in the streets is considered an ancient hazard, as horse racing occurred on streets for centuries, 
        and street racing in automobiles is likely as old as the automobile itself. It became especially prevalent during
         the heyday of hot rodding and muscle cars and it continues to be both popular and hazardous, with deaths and 
         maiming of bystanders, passengers, and drivers occurring every year. In the United States, modern street racing 
         traces its roots back to Woodward Avenue, Michigan, in the 1960s when the three main Detroit-based American car 
         companies were producing high-powered performance cars. Since a private racing venue was not always available, 
         street races would be held illegally on public roads.
