    <h1>The Best Racecars for Racing</h1>

        <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px;">Street racing is typically an unsanctioned and illegal form of auto racing that occurs on a public road. Street Racing often involves dangerous dodging of cars and speeding past traffic lights. It is often very fast and adrenaline-inducing, and so can often result in accidents, harming both the driver & passengers and other people. Street racing is illegal, sure, but so is jaywalking and littering, you don't see people stop doing that.</p>
